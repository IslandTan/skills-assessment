# Development Experience

* **C#** - It's a high level language that you can use to do lots of different things.  There always seems to be more to learn, and new commands, or a differnt way to do somethings.
* **SQL** - SQL is just fun.  You can do really powerful data manipulation with just a few key strokes.  One of the things that I have found really interesting is that a lot of BA's don't know much SQL, but are willing to learn.  It didn't take a lot to get a few of them started and wanting to learn more.
* **API's** - A good API allows you to integrate what has already been created, without having to recreate it.
* **Visual Studio** - A really full featured IDE that seems to be infinitely expandable.


# Git Commands
* **stash** - Used to store changes that you are not yet ready to commit.  Used a lot when your direction changes in the middle of a project.  Say, there is a prod bug you need to fix right now, but you are in the middle of some updates.  You can stash your updates for later.
* In all honesty, I normally work with git from within whatever source control a company has chosen to work, or from Visual Studio.  I seldom use the base commands from the command prompt.  But this was a fun refresher!


# Continuing Education
* Over the course of my career, I have done a lot of learning on the job.  Much of my learning has been by looking at examples and googling the internet.
* Currently, there are a lot of options for online learning, like lynda.com and udemy.com.
* The online documentation available for most products, but especially microsoft products, has really gotten very good.
* My son is a Computer Science major at Iowa State, so lately I have been learning how little I know.
