# Development Experience

* **C#** - It's a high level language that you can use to do lots of different things.  There always seems to be more to learn, and new commands, or a differnt way 
		to do somethings.
* **SQL** - SQL is just fun.  You can do really powerful data manipulation with just a few key strokes.  One of the things that I have found really interesting is 
		that a lot of BA's don't know much SQL, but are willing to learn.  It didn't take a lot to get a few of them started and wanting to learn more.
* **API's** - A good API allows you to integrate what has already been created, without having to recreate it.
* **Visual Studio** - A really full featured IDE that seems to be infinitely expandable.
